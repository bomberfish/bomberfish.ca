macOS is a nice operating system, but is very lacking in good functionality out of the box. Thankfully, lots of solutions exist for minor nitpicks and issues.

All apps are free unless indicated otherwise, and I am not affiliated with any of the developers.
Expect this list to be updated over time.

## Productivity

[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) ($30, but free trial can be reset by clearing app data) is an app that can hide excess menu bar items until you expand them. As mentioned earlier, if you clear the app data (e.g. using AppCleaner), the free trial can be extended by another 30 days.
## Development
### Warp

[AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) lets you completely and thoroughly uninstall apps on macOS. It's pretty useful for clearing the data of apps that download a lot of miscellaneous files.
